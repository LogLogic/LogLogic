## üîπ About Me

I am a recent cybersecurity graduate actively pursuing an entry-level SOC Analyst role. My background includes hands-on experience in incident detection, phishing analysis, and malware triage through a simulated SOC environment. I hold four active CompTIA certifications and have developed security-focused tools using Python and PowerShell to strengthen my technical skills.

Currently focused on building a professional portfolio demonstrating core SOC capabilities: threat detection, log analysis, system hardening, and incident documentation.

## Projects

### Email & Phishing Analysis  
Investigations focused on phishing, email header analysis, link and attachment triage, and social engineering detection.

- [üìß Phishing Email ‚Äì German PayPal Spoof](https://github.com/LogLogic/EmailPhishingAnalysis/tree/main/PhishingEmailGermanPaypal) ‚Äî Step-by-step phishing investigation involving spoofed sender, obfuscated malicious link, and VirusTotal analysis. Includes screenshots and full analyst report.
- [üìß Phishing Email ‚Äì United Scientific Equipment Impersonation](https://github.com/LogLogic/EmailPhishingAnalysis/tree/main/EmailPhishingAnalysisUnitedScientific) ‚Äî Business-themed phishing case with ZIP attachment containing a malware-laced `.exe`. Investigation includes email header review, IP geolocation, hash analysis using Command Prompt, and VirusTotal confirmation.  

### Log Analysis & Threat Detection  
Parsing system, authentication, and web logs to identify suspicious activity.
  
- üß© Log Parser (Multi-Source) *(In Progress)* ‚Äî Framework for ingesting logs from multiple sources with modular rule-based alerting.

### Network Traffic & Forensics  
Network packet capture and analysis for incident investigation, malware detection, and threat hunting.

- [üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fake antivirus redirect campaign analysis (Wireshark)]() ‚Äî Case study explorin a multi-stage browser-based attack involving JavaScript injection, chained redirects across attacker-controlled domains, and a final tech support scam landing page. Demonstrates TCP stream analysis, HTTP inspection, IOC extraction, and real-world threat hunting techniques.

### Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering  
Basic static and dynamic behavioral analysis of malware.

*(In progress)*

### SIEM, Dashboards & Detection Engineering  
Splunk dashboards and alert workflow automation for security monitoring and detection.

- [üìä Brute Force Login Detection in Splunk](https://github.com/LogLogic/SIEMDashboardsDetectionEngineering/tree/main/BruteForceDetectionSplunk) ‚Äî Custom-built dashboards and scheduled alerts for detecting anomalies and security threats. Demonstrates real-world use cases including log ingestion, SPL queries, visualization, and alerting for brute force login attempts.
- [üé£ Phishing Email Detection in Splunk](https://github.com/LogLogic/SIEMDashboardsDetectionEngineering/tree/main/PhishingEmailAnalysisSplunk) ‚Äî Scheduled alert and bar chart dashboards for detecting spoofed phishing emails that fail SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication. Demonstrates real-world use cases including email log ingestion, field extraction, alert configuration, IOC enrichment, and triage-ready reporting for phishing attempts.


### Tools & Automation  
Scripts in Python and PowerShell to automate SOC analyst tasks.

- **[üîç Email Header & Link Analyzer (Python)](https://github.com/LogLogic/EmailHeaderLinkAnalyzer)** ‚Äî Parses email headers, extracts URLs, and automates phishing investigations. Integrates VirusTotal, WHOIS, and domain mismatch checks. Generates investigation-ready reports.
- **[üìà Log File Analyzer (Python)](https://github.com/LogLogic/LogFileAnalyzer)** ‚Äî Detects brute-force attempts, URL scanning, and access to sensitive paths in Apache logs.  
- **[üß† Suspicious Process & Behavior Analyzer (Python)](https://github.com/LogLogic/SuspiciousProcessBehaviorAnalyzer)** ‚Äî Analyzes system process trees and behavior for suspicious parent-child relationships and known malicious patterns.
- **[üõ°Ô∏è PowerShell Phishing Triage Toolkit](https://github.com/LogLogic/ToolsAutomation/blob/main/PowerShellPhishingTriageToolkit)** ‚Äî  Automates extraction of IOCs from email headers, including IPs, domains, and URLs, with integrated VirusTotal reputation lookups.

### Learning & Labs  
Notes and guides documenting continuous learning.
