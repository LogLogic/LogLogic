## üîπ About Me

I am a recent cybersecurity graduate actively pursuing an entry-level SOC Analyst role. My background includes hands-on experience in incident detection, phishing analysis, and malware triage through a simulated SOC environment. I hold four active CompTIA certifications and have developed security-focused tools using Python and PowerShell to strengthen my technical skills.

Currently focused on building a professional portfolio demonstrating core SOC capabilities: threat detection, log analysis, system hardening, and incident documentation.
