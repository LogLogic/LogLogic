## Summary

I am a recent cybersecurity graduate actively pursuing an entry-level SOC Analyst role. My background includes hands-on experience in incident detection, phishing analysis, and malware triage through a simulated SOC environment. I hold four active CompTIA certifications and have developed security-focused tools using Python and PowerShell to strengthen my technical skills.

Currently focused on building a professional portfolio demonstrating core SOC capabilities: threat detection, log analysis, system hardening, and incident documentation.

## Projects

### [Email Header & Link Analyzer](https://github.com/LogLogic/EmailHeaderLinkAnalyzer)  
**Python**  
Parses email headers, extracts URLs, and performs automated phishing investigations. Integrates VirusTotal, WHOIS, and domain mismatch checks. Generates investigation-ready reports.

### [Log File Analyzer](https://github.com/LogLogic/LogFileAnalyzer)  
**Python**  
Python tool that parses Apache access logs to detect suspicious activity such as brute-force login attempts, URL scanning, and access to sensitive paths. Helps identify anomalies and potential indicators of compromise for proactive incident response.

### [Suspicious Process & Behavior Analyzer](https://github.com/LogLogic/SuspiciousProcessBehaviorAnalyzer)
**Python**  
Analyzes process trees and system behavior to detect suspicious parent-child relationships, unusual command-line arguments, and known malicious patterns.

### SIEM Dashboard with Splunk *(In Progress)*  
**Splunk**  
Custom Splunk dashboard built with simulated log data to visualize alerts, identify anomalies, and support detection use cases. Focus on authentication, web activity, and system changes.

### Log Parser (Multi-Source) *(In Progress)*  
**Python**  
Framework for ingesting logs from multiple sources (web, auth, system), normalizing formats, and identifying security-relevant events. Modular design for rule-based alerting.
